In [Brokk: AI for Large (Java) Codebases](https://foojay.io/today/brokk-for-java-developers/) @Jonathan Ellis wrote: Brokk is designed to address the challenges AI faces when working with large Java codebases. Unlike IDE plugins like VSCode or IntelliJ, Brokk functions as a standalone application to help developers supervise AI more effectively. It acknowledges two main sources of AI errors: insufficient problem-solving capacity, and lack of comprehensive understanding of code dependencies. While AI continues to improve, large codebases still pose challenges due to complexities in data structures and dependencies. Brokk aims to mitigate these with tools that allow developers to understand the AI's decision-making process and intervene when necessary.

Brokk employs Java Swing for its interface, Joern for code analysis, Jlama for local inference, and langchain4j for API access. It offers an intuitive interface with five main areas: instructions, output, activity, workspace, and Git. A key feature is the Workspace, which manages context by handling various file types and contexts like source files, Git diffs, and method usages. This allows developers to efficiently make changes across a codebase. By minimizing the context loaded at any given time, Brokk ensures faster and more cost-effective calls to language learning models, ultimately increasing productivity and reducing technical debt.
